Question:
How does mileage affect the price of used cars across brands?

A description:
The Mileage vs Price scatter plot was selected to examine how vehicle usage affects resale value. While this chart is typically expected to show a negative correlation—indicating that cars with higher mileage tend to sell for less—the pattern was not clearly defined when considering all makes and models. This lack of clarity highlighted the complexity of the used car market, where factors like brand reputation, fuel type, and model features can obscure mileage-price trends.

To narrow the focus, a second scatter plot filtered to only Hyundai vehicles was introduced. This allowed for a brand-specific investigation, isolating patterns within a single manufacturer. However, the resulting trend still suggested that brand alone may not account for price variation, and a more granular breakdown by specific models (e.g., Hyundai Elantra vs. Sonata) would have provided more insight. Unfortunately, the dataset did not include a model column, and external attempts to source this information proved unsuccessful.

The Make vs Price bar chart complements the scatter plots by offering a macro-level view of brand-based pricing differences. This visual makes it easy to compare average prices across manufacturers, helping users quickly identify which brands tend to be priced higher versus those that are more budget-friendly. This is especially useful for buyers interested in comparing options across brands with similar mileage or features.

To enhance interactivity and usability, filter widgets such as sliders for mileage_run and dropdown menus for make and make_year were included. These controls empower users to tailor the dashboard to their specific interests—such as viewing only manual transmission cars, or comparing cars from specific years—and support more meaningful exploration. The combination of broad comparisons and focused filters creates a flexible and informative user experience.
